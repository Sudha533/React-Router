# React-Router
### What is React Router?
Imagine, you are building a website with different pages like a home page, about us page and contact us page. React Router helps us to manage theses pages in React App.
### How it works?
1. Setting up Routes
	 We tell React Router which components to show each URL. For example, you might say ,"When some one goes to /login, show them the login component"
2. Navigating between pages
	You can create links in your app that, when clickes, take users to different pages. React handles in smoothly without refreshing the whlole page.
3. Dynamic pages
	Sometimes, you want part of your URL to change based on what the user is doing. React Router lets you do it easily. For instance, you could have a URL like "product/1" where 1 is the Id of the product
4. History Management
   React Router helps you manage the browser's history. So, if a user clicks the back button, React Router knows how to handle it, making your app feel more like a regular website.
   
   Overall, React Router is like a map for your React app, helping you navigate between different parts of your website smoothly.
